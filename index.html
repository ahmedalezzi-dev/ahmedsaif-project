            <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
        
            <h3>1. Feature Scaling (Standardization)</h3>
            <p>To ensure that all features contribute equally to the model, we scaled the features using <strong>StandardScaler</strong>. This scaling technique transforms the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is particularly important for algorithms like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are sensitive to the scale of input features.</p>
        
            <h3>2. Target Variable Encoding (Label Encoding)</h3>
            <p>The target variable, <strong>"Air Quality Levels"</strong>, was encoded using <strong>Label Encoding</strong>. The original categories, such as "Good," "Moderate," and "Poor," were mapped to unique numeric labels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Good</strong> -> Class 0</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate</strong> -> Class 1</li>
                <li><strong>Poor</strong> -> Class 2</li>
                <li><strong>Hazardous</strong> -> Class 3</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The results of the air quality classification task demonstrate the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting the target variable with high accuracy. A comparative analysis of the models showed the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> This model achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 95.8%, precision of 99%, recall of 99%, and an F1-score of 99%. The ensemble nature of the Random Forest likely contributed to its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> This model performed well, achieving an accuracy of 94%, but it was slightly outperformed by the Random Forest. While it is simpler and faster, it may not capture complex patterns as effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM):</strong> The SVM model also delivered strong performance with an accuracy of 94%, demonstrating its capability in handling the classification problem with a non-linear kernel.</li>
            </ul>
        
        
            <h3>Key Observations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Random Forest</strong> model outperformed others due to its ability to combine predictions from multiple decision trees, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.</li>
                <li>The performance difference between <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>  and <strong>SVM</strong>  was minimal, showing both are competitive for this dataset.</li>
            
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Future Directions:</h3>
            <p>To further improve model performance and robustness, the following steps can be explored:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Incorporating additional features or external datasets, such as weather conditions or traffic data, to capture more variability.</li>
                <li>Applying advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as Bayesian optimization, for fine-grained model optimization.</li>
                <li>Testing other ensemble methods, such as Gradient Boosting or XGBoost, which may yield even better results.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>In conclusion, the Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance for this task, making it the preferred choice for predicting air quality levels based on the given dataset.</p>
